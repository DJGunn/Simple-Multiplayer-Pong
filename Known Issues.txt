Known Bugs:
1) If there is a lurker, and one of the players leaves. The server will crash if the lurker tries to talk.
2) There is a slight delay between paddle movement and arrow pressing.

New Bugs (3/1/2015):
1) The introduction of artificial latency has introduced a bug where the countdown between rounds is broadcast to the clients
all at once instead of in 1 second intervals. Due to the nature of the artificial latency, this is only temporary and will not
exist once the artificial latency is removed, as such, this is not a true bug, but a psuedo-bug and not worthy of 'fixing' since
it would negatively impact the program's -actual- functionality when not using artificial latency.
2) The artificial latency causes an occassional server crash when a player leaves. Similar to above this is only a psuedo-bug
and not worthy of fixing, since it will no longer exist once we move on to the next milestone and remove artificial latency.
