A multiplayer pong game with support for chat and spectators.

Server is written in C++ using the windows API for winsock2 sockets handling.

Client is written in Javascript/HTML.

This was a quarter long project for a networking games course @ the University of California, Irvine.

I did not write:
base64.cpp sha1.cpp websocket.cpp
base64.h sha1.h websocket.h

Though I did make some edits to websocket.cpp/h in order to fix a bug that I discovered in the code and to adapt the sockets code for my needs, but since it's been years I can't point out the particular edits or additional functions/code I added to these files.

Finally, I did add comments to the code to help my own understanding of it.

All other files are my purely own original work/code.

Thankss
